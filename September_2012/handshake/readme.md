## Handshake changes 
### Changes in the way people greet in the UK

**H**ow  do you greet people in your country? In the UK, a handshake has been the traditional way to say hello. But this seems to be changing.

A new **survey** shows that the handshake is now less popular. According to results from the **poll**, many Britons now consider handshakeing "formal, **outdated**" or "**unhygienic**". In the past, the British **looked down on** hugging or kissing as a form of greeting, but not any longer. In fact, almost 50 percent are using alternative ways to greet, with 16 percent preferring a continental-style **peck on the cheek**, and nearly a third choosing a hug.

The study of 1,003 participants, **commissioned** by soap firm Radox, also found that one in five now feels that shaking hands is 'too formal'; while 42 percent said they'd only do it in a business context. Forty two percent also said they would never shake hands when greeting friends, and one in 12 said they preferred not to shake hands in case germs are **passed on**. However, 87 percent still believe a handshake is more appropriate in business.

Psychologist Dr Jane McCartney said, " I think the handshake is dependent on age. The older you are the more likely you are to prefer the handshake. It's quite a formal introduction. So, it's quite nice that today's generation feel far less **reserved.**"

So, what's your favourite form of greeting?
