### Changes in the way people greet in the UK

**H**ow  do you greet people in your country? In the UK, a handshake has been the traditional way to say hello. But this seems to be changing.

A new **survey** shows that the handshake is now less popular. According to results from the **poll**, many Britons now consider handshakeing "formal, **outdated**" or "**unhygienic**". In the past, the British **looked down on** hugging or kissing as a form of greeting, but not any longer. In fact, almost 50 percent are using alternative ways to greet, with 16 percent preferring a continental-style **peck on the cheek**, and nearly a third choosing a hug.

The study of 1,003 participants, **commissioned** by soap firm Radox, also found that one in five now feels that shaking hands is 'too formal'; while 42 percent said they'd only do it in a business context. Forty two percent also said they would never shake hands when greeting friends, and one in 12 said they preferred not to shake hands in case germs are **passed on**. However, 87 percent still believe a handshake is more appropriate in business.

Psychologist Dr Jane McCartney said, " I think the handshake is dependent on age. The older you are the more likely you are to prefer the handshake. It's quite a formal introduction. So, it's quite nice that today's generation feel far less **reserved.**"

So, what's your favourite form of greeting?

## Handshaking trivia

Psychologists say that the handshake can help us form an opinion of the other person. And in numerous tests in the UK and US,

those who have a firm handshake are judged more positively. But other things are important too, such as eye-contact and 

positive body language such as smile and a tilt of the head to show openness.

It is estimated that Queen Elizabeth II has shaken more than half a million hands. This is compared with 670 for an average

man over his lifetime and 304 for women. The handshake is thought to have been introduced by Sir Walter Raleigh in Britain 

during the late 16th century.
